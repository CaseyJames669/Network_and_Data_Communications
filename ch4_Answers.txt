Only a single winner in this approach and it's going to be the
node with the highest bit address. Leaving the low numbered nodes
to be starved from sending packets.

1)Time take to error correcting is less than doing detection and retransmission.
This uses less bandwidth overall.
2)In detection and retransmission if back messaging occurs more bandwidth will
be used.

Privacy - the potential exists for tag "sniffing". Like ethernet networks, wireless
tag communications are subject to capture and analysis.
The information inside RFID tags is vulnerable to alteration, corruption and
deletion.

Store and forward switches receive an entire packet before they begin sending any
data at all. Cut through switches can receive the first few bytes of a packet,
decide which port/ports to send it on, and then start sending out the packet
while the rest of the packet is still being received.
Cut through switching only works if both ports are operating at the same speed.
Cut through switching only works if the output port/ports happen to be 
available while a packet is being received.
